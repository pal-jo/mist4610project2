# Dataset Description: Food Affordability in California (2006–2010)

This dataset comes from the U.S. government’s open data catalog and was published by the California Department of Public Health as part of the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project. It measures the food affordability for female-headed households with children under 18 across different racial and ethnic groups in California. The data covers the years 2006 to 2010 and includes information at the state, county, and city level.

The goal of this dataset is to show how affordable a basic basket of healthy food is, relative to income, for different communities across the state. The affordability metric is based on the cost of food as a percentage of household income — the higher the percentage, the less affordable food is considered to be.

This dataset helps show which communities in California are struggling the most with food costs. By looking at how much of their income different groups spend on food, it displays where the biggest gaps and challenges are. It’s especially useful for researchers, public health workers, and policymakers who want to better understand food insecurity, make fair decisions about where to send support, and track whether things are getting better over time.
